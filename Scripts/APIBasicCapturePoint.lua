The basic capture point API works with capture point components to enable a variety of other components to properly
interact with them. This includes UI, game modes, round logic, score, and more. Capture point components handle
replication. Basic capture points progress while only one team has members present. Note that team 0 cannot control a
capture point. Destroying or removing a capture point during gameplay is not supported.

Capture points must expose the following functions, passed to RegisterCapturePoint in the follow table
{
	table GetState() [Client, Server]				Returns a table (below) describing the current state of the point
	bool IsPlayerPresent(Player) [Client, Server]	Returns whether the given player is present on this point
	nil Reset() [Server]							Resets the capture point
	nil SetEnabled(bool) [Server]					Sets enabled state
}

Capture point state is represented by the following table:
{
	string id										Id of the point
	string name										Name assigned to the capture point
	Vector3 worldPosition							World position of the point
	int progressedTeam								Which team currently has progress on the point
	int owningTeam									Which team currently owns the point
	float captureProgress							How much capture progress the capturing team has [0.0, 1.0]
	float captureThreshold							How much progress is needed for the point to be captured
	int friendliesPresent							Number of players on the progressed team present
	int enemiesPresent								Number of players not on the progressed team present
	bool isEnabled									If the capture point is enabled
	int attackingTeam								If non-zero, only the specified team can capture this point
	int order										The spot in order this capture point should take
}

If owningTeam is 0, friendliesPresent will be 0, but even with enemies, they may be on multiple teams.

Capture points broadcast the following event:
CapturePointOwnerChanged(string id, int oldOwner, int newOwner)
CapturePointEnabledStateChanged(string id, bool oldEnabled, bool newEnabled)
